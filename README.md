[see here for the complete documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ABQu6RFgA7GnLE-drZTrBpFz_z4TNEYkRaLVHUDeO3k/edit?usp=sharing).

This project was my first attempt at implementing a simple neural network which I built with Matlab, exported as DLL, and used it in
MetaTrader's system with their programming language called MQL5.
